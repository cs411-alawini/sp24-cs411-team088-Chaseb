## Project Summary
We aim to build a website which allows users to check for detailed information of the car they search(Ex: Make, Model, Engine, Fuel Type). The user can also compare a specific aspect of the car( Ex: Engine difference between Mustang and Camaro) to have a better understanding of differences. What is more, this website will also include the recent sales information on used cars so that the users can know about the price of the car they liked, what is more we will also include a market price which allows the user to compare and find out the car with the best price that they can afford. For interaction, the user can login with their account, find the car they like to know by searching names or choose the constraints. The user can also compare the car with others on the specific performance.
